# SciPy
This is my attempt at learning how to use basic data science constructs with python
Used the ideas below if you want to do similar things to me. By no means am i an expert - im a sixth form student!

## Web Scraping

Using Webscraping techniques in order to get data from desired websites

## Data visualisation

Using matplotlib and seaborn to plot graphs
Using Raw data to create a csv file which displays the raw data
 
## SciKit learn

Creating and using differenct classification models on data. For example (MLP, SVC, Random forrest and decision trees)
Also using a StandardScalar and cleansing data

### NB

If there is any suggestion feel free to let me know!
